# Hello-World
A new repository
Hi My names is Ray.
It's been a long time no coding.
Almost thought I won't be a programmer again.
It need take times to pick up the memories.
Hope I can rebuild a whole new programming skills.
And learn from all the best coders.
Just want to encourage myself. 
Keep going, never give up. Try a bit of a day.
One day, you should be better than now!
